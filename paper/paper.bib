  abstract = {Stock and flow diagrams are widely used in epidemiology to model the dynamics of populations. Although tools already exist for building these diagrams and simulating the systems they describe, we have created a new package called StockFlow, part of the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem, which uses ideas from category theory to overcome notable limitations of existing software. Compositionality is provided by the theory of decorated cospans: stock and flow diagrams can be composed to form larger ones in an intuitive way formalized by the operad of undirected wiring diagrams. Our approach also cleanly separates the syntax of stock and flow diagrams from the semantics they can be assigned. We consider semantics in ordinary differential equations, although others are possible. As an example, we explain code in StockFlow that implements a simplified version of a COVID-19 model used in Canada.},

  abstract = {In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a ‘cobordism’: a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum field theory and ‘quantum topology’. But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of ‘closed symmetric monoidal category’. We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.},

  abstract = {Modeling and Simulation have become endeavors central to all disciplines of science and engineering. They are used in the analysis of physical systems where they help us gain a better understanding of the functioning of our physical world. They are also important to the design of new engineering systems where they enable us to predict the behavior of a system before it is ever actually built. Modeling and simulation are the only techniques available that allow us to analyze arbitrarily non-linear systems accurately and under varying experimental conditions. Continuous System Modeling introduces the student to an important subclass of these techniques. They deal with the analysis of systems described through a set of ordinary or partial differential equations or through a set of difference equations. This volume introduces concepts of modeling physical systems through a set of differential and/or difference equations. The purpose is twofold: it enhances the scientific understanding of our physical world by codifying (organizing) knowledge about this world, and it supports engineering design by allowing us to assess the consequences of a particular design alternative before it is actually built. This text has a flavor of the mathematical discipline of dynamical systems, and is strongly oriented towards Newtonian physical science},

This survey uses recent advances in organizational economics to illuminate organizational failures along these two dimensions. We combine reviews of the literature with simple models and case discussions. Specifically, we consider failures related to short-termism and the allocation of authority, both of which are instances of "multitasking problems"; communication failures in the presence of both soft and hard information due to incentive misalignments; resistance to change due to vested interests and rigid cultures; and failures related to the allocation of talent and miscommunication due to bounded rationality. We find that the organizational economics literature provides parsimonious explanations for a large range of economically significant failures. ( JEL D21, D23, D82, D83, M10)},

This paper answers the call for a unifying framework by outlining a declarative, graphical modeling framework that represents system behavior through the composition of set functions. The basis for the framework derives from behavioral systems theory, which supports the interpretation of a digital twin as two coupled systems that share behavior so that properties of one are observable from the other. Interoperability is addressed by encoding the twinned system behavior in a model structure providing universal simulation. A case study involving the development of a digital twin for a micro-energy grid demonstrates the extensibility provided by the framework, allowing digital twins to be redeployed into independent ecosystems or combined into system of systems digital twin aggregates.},

  abstract = {Declarative modeling frameworks, such as Modelica, are often used to represent systems that require reusable and interoperable models. Simulation in such a framework requires a solver that is capable of transforming the model into an executable process.  However, most declarative solvers are insular, in that they are unable to integrate with software applications needed for simulating complex systems, limiting their usability for simulating multi-domain models. This paper describes a process for creating declarative models that can integrate with an external tool by deconstructing its Application Programmer Interface (API) into a set of functions arranged into a constraint hypergraph. The constraint hypergraph's solver is shown to be capable of automatically parsing these functions to simulate arbitrary pairs of inputs and outputs. The result is a holistic modeling framework that allows for flexible simulation of a complex system, integrates directly with otherwise sequestered platforms, and reveals cross-cutting interactions between system elements. This is demonstrated by integrating the solid modeling capabilities of Onshape with a dynamic model of a crankshaft from a piston engine, showing how a geometric model can be integrated with independently-defined dynamic models. This validates the framework on a limited scale, setting the foundation for work for fully integrating disparate tools into multi-domain, multi-physics modeling and simulation.},

Multi-domain system models are traditionally compiled from many diverse frameworks, each based in a single domain. Incompatibilities between these frameworks prevent information from being shared resulting in data silos, duplicate work, and knowledge gaps. A constraint hypergraph addresses these problems by providing a universal modeling framework within which all model prescriptions can be expressed. This methodology expands mathematical structures previously explored in abstract mathematics and systems theory into a new executable framework. Each hypergraph expresses the holistic behavior of a system in a declarative paradigm that describes the relationships between system properties. In addition to modeling, it is shown how constraint hypergraphs can be used for universal, cross-cutting simulation through principles of function composition. The theoretical framework of a constraint hypergraph is demonstrated with a practical representation of a hybrid system, combining a discrete-event simulation and continuous PID controller into a single model of an elevator lift system.},

With the evolution of personalised healthcare, there is a significant need to represent a virtual replica for individuals to provide the right type of care in the right way and at the right time. Therefore, in this paper, we surveyed the concept of a personal digital twin (PDT) as an enhanced version of the DT with actionable insight capabilities. In particular, PDT can bring value to patients by enabling more accurate decision making and proper treatment selection and optimisation. Then, we explored the progression of PDT as a revolutionary technology in healthcare research and industry. However, although several research works have been performed for smart healthcare using DT, PDT is still at an early stage. Consequently, we believe that this work can be a step towards smart personalised healthcare industry by guiding the design of industrial personalised healthcare systems. Accordingly, we introduced a reference framework that empowers smart personalised healthcare using PDTs by bringing together existing advanced technologies (i.e., DT, blockchain, and AI). Then, we described some selected use cases, including the mitigation of COVID-19 contagion, COVID-19 survivor follow-up care, personalised COVID-19 medicine, personalised osteoporosis prevention, personalised cancer survivor follow-up care, and personalised nutrition. Finally, we identified further challenges to pave the PDT paradigm toward the smart personalised healthcare industry.},

Well-known temporal logics---such as Linear and Metric Temporal Logic (LTL and MTL)---embed within the logic of temporal type theory. The types in this theory represent "behavior types". The language is rich enough to allow one to define arbitrary hybrid dynamical systems, which are mixtures of continuous dynamics---e.g. as described by a differential equation---and discrete jumps. In particular, the derivative of a continuous real-valued function is internally defined. We construct a semantics for the temporal type theory in the topos of sheaves on a translation-invariant quotient of the standard interval domain. In fact, domain theory plays a recurring role in both the semantics and the type theory.},

The central notion is the behavior, which consists of the set of time trajectories that are declared possible by the model of a dynamical system. Often, the behavior is defined as the set of solutions of a system of differential equations. Models that specify a behavior usually involve latent variables in addition to the manifest variables the model aims at. We have also described a methodology for modeling interconnected systems, called tearing, zooming, and linking. The underlying mathematical language consists of terminals, modules, the interconnection graph, the module embedding, and the manifest variable assignment. The combination of module equations, interconnection constraints, and manifest variable assignment leads to a latent-variable representation for the behavior of the manifest variables the model aims. This methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking offers a systematic procedure for modeling interconnected systems that is much better adapted to the physics of interconnected systems than input/output-modeling procedures such as, for example, Simulink. The methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking has many things in common with bond graphs.},
