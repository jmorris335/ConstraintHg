This is a simple list showing many of the places we've seen CHGs used. If you find more,
reach out to us to include them here! 

Note that many simple examples are available in the 
`demos <https://github.com/jmorris335/ConstraintHg/tree/main/demos>`_ directory of the repository.

`Pendulum <https://github.com/jmorris335/ConstraintHg/blob/main/demos/demo_pendulum.py>`_
    Demonstrates model selection.

`Double Pendulum <https://github.com/jmorris335/DrivenPendulum>`_
    Demonstrates more complicated behavioral descriptions and assumptions.

`Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing Machine <https://github.com/jmorris335/Powder-Based-Fusion-Digital-Twin>`_
    Demonstrates interoperability between different part models.

`Elevator <https://github.com/jmorris335/ElevatorHypergraph>`_
    Combines discrete-event simulation with a PID controller.

`Naval Microgrid <https://github.com/jmorris335/MicrogridHg>`_
    Complex system featuring data querying and dynamic simulation and linear systems.

`Crankshaft <https://github.com/jmorris335/tool-interoperability-scripts/tree/main>`_
    Shows how different software can be integrated together such as CAD (Onshape), FEA (Ansys), and MATLAB.
