Unified Systems Modeling and Simulation: `DOI <https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4068375>`__
    First published paper covering Contraint Hypergraphs, goes into technical 
    details about how they are defined. A video overview is available `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQaxbmd1yds>`__

Integrating Simulation Software with CHGs: `Linked here <https://www.people.clemson.edu/jhmrrs/publications/#:~:text=Declarative%20Integration%20of%20CAD%20Software%20into%20Multi%2DPhysics%20Simulation%20via%20Constraint%20Hypergraphs>`__
    Shows how CHGs enable declarative modeling between simulation software, 
    demonstrating with integration of a dynamic model with Onshape's CAD API. 
    The code for this model is available `here <https://github.com/jmorris335/tool-interoperability-scripts/tree/main>`__

Constraint Hypergraphs as a foundation for Digital Twins: `Preprint <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.05494>`__
    Paper showing how CHGs form a robust framework for working with digital twins, 
    enabling observation and simulation for autonomous agents.
