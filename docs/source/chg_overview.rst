Good Starting Points
====================

- Brief Introduction with examples: :doc:`chg_intro`
- High level overview of using CHGs with digital twins: `<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph2yhaThex0>`_

More In-Depth
=============

Unified Systems Modeling and Simulation: `<https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4068375>`_
    First published paper covering Contraint Hypergraphs, goes into technical 
    details about how they are defined. A video overview is available `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQaxbmd1yds>`_

Demonstrations
==============

This is a simple list showing many of the places we've seen CHGs used. If you find more,
reach out to us to include them here! 

Note that many simple examples are available in the 
`demos <https://github.com/jmorris335/ConstraintHg/tree/main/demos>`_ directory of the repository.

`Pendulum <https://github.com/jmorris335/ConstraintHg/blob/main/demos/demo_pendulum.py>`_
    Demonstrates model selection.

`Elevator <https://github.com/jmorris335/ElevatorHypergraph>`_
    Combines discrete-event simulation with a PID controller.

`Naval Microgrid <https://github.com/jmorris335/MicrogridHg>`_
    Complex system featuring data querying and dynamic simulation and linear systems.

`Crankshaft <https://github.com/jmorris335/tool-interoperability-scripts/tree/main>`_
    Integrates CAD software (Onshape) with dynamic simulation.
