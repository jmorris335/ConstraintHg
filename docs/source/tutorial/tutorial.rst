ConstraintHg Tutorial
=====================

ConstraintHg is a tool for simulating systems. It provides tools for representing and simulating `constraint hypergraphs <../CHGs/chg_overview>`_. It can take in models from across different domains, use cases, and representation schemes, integrating them into a single, queryable structure. Once organized, ConstraintHg allows modelers to aggregate systems (for systems of systems modeling), perform model selection, and, most important of all, autonomously build simulations.

The following tutorial will walk you through how to use ConstraintHg by building a model of a simple pendulum. Note that the full script is available `here <https://github.com/jmorris335/ConstraintHg/blob/main/demos/demo_pendulum.py>`_. For more advanced examples, check out the `Demonstrations <../demos>`_ page. Questions? Get in touch with us on our `discussion board <about/contact>`_!
