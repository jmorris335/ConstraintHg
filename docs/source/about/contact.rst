.. start contact

Our primary method of communication is our `discussion board <https://github.com/jmorris335/ConstraintHg/discussions>`_ on GitHub. Please use this for discussing software, asking for help, asking about new features, etc. If it's about ConstraintHg, then it should probably go on the discussion board. 

The board also features more theoretical discussions, for instance how the software should be designed, and how we should be working with constraint hypergraphs. Check out our `subtopics <https://github.com/jmorris335/ConstraintHg/discussions/categories/constraint-hypergraph-theory>`_ for more information.
