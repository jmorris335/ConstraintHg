==========

.. start install

Use `PIP <https://pypi.org/project/constrainthg/>`_ to install ConstraintHg into your Python environment::

   pip install constrainthg

From there you'll want to import the library into your Python script. 
This is a pretty typical method to use:

.. code-block:: python

   from constrainthg.hypergraph import Node, Hypergraph
   import constrainthg.relations as R

.. end install
